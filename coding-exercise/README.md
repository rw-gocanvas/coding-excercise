# Coding Exercise - Gabi Procell

I utilized a zoo animal API (https://zoo-animal-api.herokuapp.com) to pull animal data and their image into the app. 

To start: clone this repo, cd into the directory and again into the coding-exercise directory, then `npm install` followed by `npm start`.

The site should run on `localhost:3000`;
