# GoCanvas: Coding Excercise

## Assignment

Pull data from an API and render that data in the browser. 

This can be as simple as a styled list of entries from any of the public APIs below. Don’t spend more than 2-3 hours on this. The code doesn’t need to be perfect, but you should be able to talk about the decisions you made when building it.

## Goals

The primary goal of this excercise is to provide us with code that we can discuss during the technical portion of the interview. If you already have a project that you've created that would fit the criteria please feel free to submit that instead.

## To Start: 
cd into the directory and again into the coding-exercise directory, then `npm install` followed by `npm start`.

The site should run on `localhost:3000`;
